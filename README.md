# Multi-Disease Diagnosis App

## Overview
This application uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on patient health metrics. Currently implemented disease predictions:
- Diabetes

## Features
- **User-friendly interface** for entering patient data
- **Instant predictions** with probability scores
- **Visualization tools** to understand prediction factors
- **Multiple disease models** in a single application

## How It Works
1. Enter patient health metrics in the application
2. The app processes this data through trained machine learning models
3. Results show disease prediction with confidence level
4. Visualizations explain which factors contributed most to the prediction

## Diabetes Prediction
### Health Metrics Used
- Pregnancies
- Glucose levels
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

### Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** The model achieves high accuracy through advanced machine learning techniques
- **Validation:** Thoroughly tested with cross-validation to ensure reliability

## Technical Details
### Machine Learning Pipeline
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy
- Model selection from multiple algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance

### Technologies Used
- **Python** for backend processing
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning models
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Streamlit** for the user interface

## Getting Started
1. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn streamlit joblib
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Future Development
- Adding more disease prediction models:
  - Heart disease
  - Liver disease
  - Cancer risk assessment
- Implementing additional visualization tools
- Adding patient data management capabilities

## Contributing
Contributions to add new disease models or improve existing ones are welcome!
